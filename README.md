# Custom HTTP Parser

A custom HTTP Parser that attempts to be compliant with HTTP/1.1 as per [RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110.html)

This is built purely for educational purposes as to get a deeper understanding for how the HTTP protocol works underneath the hood.

## TODO
- Body parsing
- Streaming
- Error handling
- Etc?
